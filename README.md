# Daily-Poem
There's a Chinese famous acient sentence says *"If there's books in your stomach, your mind will be developed"*(just like this mean QAQ).
So I created this site. It will display a diffirent poem each day(in principle, deppends on myself, if I'm a little lazy then it will be circled in a month)
Hope you like it!
